# Blacklist


This blacklist is a collection of all the ip's that have at sometime attacked my servers and are shown in my fail2ban logs.

It would be great if we could come together and start blocking *ALL* services to these IP addresses.

My hope is to make the internet a better place and to put more responsiblity on network providers to restrict this type of behaviour, the only way I can see this working initialy is if we were to all team up and globally block all traffic to these ip's.

If these ip's are not able to communicate with the outside would the network admins will investigate as to why they can not and come to the conclusion that the original cause is from user abuse and will have no choice in removing such users from their networks or risk their network not being able to communicate with the outside world.

If you would like to contribute please feel free to create a pull request.
